# Classification problem for Loan Default Prediction
## Task Summary: 

The NBFC is developing a classification model to predict loan repayment behaviour, 
specifically identifying potential defaulters and non-defaulters. The primary goal is to 
enhance risk assessment and improve the loan approval process. 

## Data Overview:

status for past 2 years+ has been kept in the file. File name: train_data.xlsx 

• Validation data: Loan disbursement application and their default and non-default 
status for past 3 months has been kept in the file. File name: test_data.xlsx 

## Key Features:

customer_id, transaction_date, sub_grade, term, home_ownership, cibil_score, etc.

Target variable: loan_status (1 for default, 0 for non-default)
